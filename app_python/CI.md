## CI best practices
Maintain a code repository

Automate the build

Make the build self-testing

Everyone commits to the baseline every day

Every commit (to baseline) should be built

Keep the build fast

Test in a clone of the production environment

Make it easy to get the latest deliverables

Everyone can see the results of the latest build

Automate deployment

## Jenkins best practices

Avoiding complex Groovy code in Pipelines

Reducing repetition of similar Pipeline steps

Avoiding calls to Jenkins.getInstance
